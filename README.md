Cyberpunk 2077 Landing Page
Frontend Developer | Live Demo | GitHub Repository

Designed and developed a responsive landing page for Cyberpunk 2077 game editions using HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript.

Implemented modern UI/UX principles with:

Dynamic, neon-themed styling (CSS animations, box shadows, gradients).

Fixed navigation bar with hover effects for seamless user experience.

Embedded YouTube video for gameplay previews.

Mobile-first approach: Optimized layout for all devices with a collapsible sidebar menu (media queries).

Interactive elements: Email submission form (HTML5 validation), styled buttons, and smooth scrolling navigation.

Technical highlights: Flexbox/Grid for layout, CSS transitions for hover effects, and semantic HTML5.
